# Tekoi - Offline Digital Credit

**Current date:** January 02, 2026  
**Version:** 1.1 (full suite)  
**Platform:** Linux Mint 19 32-bit (Python 3.6.9)  
**Status:** Not publicly launched – private, person-to-person only

## What is Tekoi?

Tekoi is an **offline digital credit**.  
No internet. No cables. No WiFi. No blockchain. No banks. No politicians deciding the value of your time.

The days of the value of a human life's time on this world being defined by a politician or a leader, nor any man but all is coming to a halt (hopefully for good) quick.

Tekoi believes in Humanity. People. Man and Woman.  
We were meant to live like a slave for the master? No.  
WE WERE MADE FOR LIFE. LOVE. SADNESS. HAPPINESS. LONELINESS. TOGETHERNESS.  
A lot of ness. (not canttendo)

Welcome to Tekoi.  
The new credit for US. The Equalizer for them.

## - - - tekoi is not launched - - -

If you would like to reserve an account please message me (tator) and I'd be glad to assist.

## - - - How Will The People Make Money - - -

Simple. Get rid of the idea that we need to have the "value" tied to a worthless reputation of a political power or a rock and put it in the future of humanity including Earth and all of her creatures.

## - - - Where the tekoi from - - -

The main Account I hold will hold an enormous amount of tekoi for future depositing for first time users. Encrypted and offline.

## - - - SECURITY? - - -

The program is designed for offline transactions. Users do security handshake from the handshake algo.

### Why it’s secure (hard to fake or steal)
- Both people must be active at the same exact time.  
  You show code → friend types it → friend shows code → you type it.  
  If someone is not there (or on phone with you right now), it can’t finish. No replay of old codes.
- Codes are random + tied to you two + amount + minute.  
  The magic “verify” string is built from:  
  `your_code + their_code + your_username + their_username + amount + current_minute`  
  Then SHA256 hash → 12 chars stored in /tmp.  
  Both sides build the exact same seed because you exchange the missing parts (codes).  
  If any part is wrong (fake code, wrong amount, wrong person, old time), the hashes don’t match → transaction fails and money rolls back.
- No data leaves your laptop except what you say out loud.  
  Fully air-gapped. Attacker would need to hear both codes live and know your usernames/amount to fake anything – impossible without being there.
- Encrypted on disk.  
  Balance, name, logs all Fernet/AES encrypted. Even if someone steals your laptop, without password = gibberish.
- Temp files auto-clean.  
  /tmp files deleted after success or fail. Reboot = gone.

**Result:** More secure than giving cash (cash can be counterfeit – here codes can’t be without both agreeing live).

### Why transactions are always correct (no mistakes, no lost tekoi)
- Double confirmation built-in.
- Step-by-step:  
  Sender → types amount → random code A → tells receiver "type 4821"  
  Receiver types 4821 → proves agreement → random code B → tells sender "now type 7394"  
  Sender types 7394 → both compute same hash → check match → commit.
- If anything wrong → automatic refund:  
  Wrong code, different amount, clock drift, early close → sender gets money back.
- Logs only written on success (encrypted files like jan-02-2026/jan022026trntionbob.enc).
